# 📈 Correlation-Based Commodity Trading Strategy

Can we profit off of fluctuations in key commodity prices?

This project investigates whether short-term movements in commodity markets (like silver, oil, and copper) can help predict price action in correlated stocks — and if those relationships can be used to generate trading signals.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Identify **correlated commodity-stock pairs** (e.g., silver and SLV, oil and XLE)
- Detect when the **relationship diverges or converges**
- Simulate **entry/exit strategies** based on these signals
- Evaluate profitability over historical data

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - Daily prices for key commodities and relevant stocks
   - Economic indicators (interest rates, DXY, volatility)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Rolling correlation windows
   - Gradients (rate of change) for leading indicators
   - Lagged predictors to test causal relationships

3. **Signal Generation**
   - Signal triggered when correlation diverges from historical norm
   - Optional: include z-score or gradient thresholds

4. **Backtesting**
   - Simulated trading based on generated signals
   - Tracks performance, win/loss rate, drawdowns

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Custom backtesting logic
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis

---

## 📊 Sample Outputs

- Top correlated pairs by day and gradient strength
- Trade signal charts
- Portfolio performance over time

---

## 🤔 Why This Matters

Commodities like silver, oil, and wheat often lead broader market movements — especially in resource-linked sectors. This project tests whether short-term dislocations in those relationships offer **arbitrage or trend-trading opportunities**.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add portfolio optimization (e.g. top N trades per day)
- Include macroeconomic filters (e.g., high VIX days only)
- Turn signal/backtester into a reusable class or API
